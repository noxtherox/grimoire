<p align="center">
  A local-first Markdown notes app built around folders, links, and files you own.
</p>

Grimoire turns an ordinary folder of Markdown files into a structured knowledge
base. Folders become note types, `[[wikilinks]]` connect ideas, and YAML
frontmatter adds queryable properties without locking your writing into a
proprietary database.

The desktop app reads and writes your files directly. You can keep using the
same vault with a text editor, Git, sync software, or any other Markdown tool.

## Highlights

- **Plain files, real folders** — choose any folder as a vault. A path such as
  `Projects/Active/Grimoire.md` appears as a nested type in the sidebar.
- **Focused Markdown editing** — CodeMirror live preview supports headings,
  lists, tables, links, tags, pasted images, and keyboard-friendly formatting.
- **Connected notes** — autocomplete `[[wikilinks]]`, follow links from the
  editor, create missing notes, and inspect backlinks grouped by note type.
- **Structured properties** — define text, number, date, checkbox, list, and
  note-relation fields. Values remain readable YAML frontmatter.
- **Fast organization** — search and filter by type, date, and properties;
  reorder types; pin or archive notes; and use a recoverable vault-local trash.
- **Work with files outside the vault** — open standalone Markdown notes without
  importing them, or associate notes with PDFs and common office documents.
- **Desktop workflow tools** — reveal notes in the system file manager, open
  links in the browser, use focus mode, and run an embedded terminal in the
  selected note's folder.
- **Personalized workspace** — resize or collapse panels and choose from built-in
  light and dark themes with a theme-aware Grimoire mark.

## How the vault works

```text
My Vault/
├── Projects/
│   ├── Active/
│   │   └── Grimoire.md
│   └── Project Index.md
├── People/
│   └── Ada.md
├── assets/                 # pasted and dropped images
├── .grimoire/              # Grimoire's vault metadata
└── .trash/                 # recoverable deleted notes
```

Each `.md` file is a note. Grimoire derives its type from its containing folders,
up to three levels deep. Moving a note to another type moves the file; changing
the title line renames it. Property values stay in the note's frontmatter, while
vault-wide property definitions and display metadata live under `.grimoire/`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and the
  [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for desktop
  development

### Install and run

```sh
pnpm install

# Browser development mode (uses a virtual vault in localStorage)
pnpm dev

# Desktop development mode (uses the real filesystem)
pnpm desktop:dev
```

Vite serves the browser app at `http://localhost:8080` by default. On first
desktop launch, choose the folder you want Grimoire to use as its vault.

## Development

```sh
pnpm test            # run the Vitest suite
pnpm build           # build the web app
pnpm desktop:build   # build installable desktop bundles for the current OS
```

The project is built with React, TypeScript, CodeMirror 6, Tailwind CSS,
shadcn/ui, and Tauri 2. The native Rust layer provides filesystem integration,
desktop file opening, and the embedded PTY terminal.

## Built with Codex and GPT-5.6

A substantial part of Grimoire's recent development was completed through an
iterative human–AI workflow using [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) with
GPT-5.6.

- **Product direction stayed human-led.** Features began with concrete goals,
  screenshots, interaction feedback, and acceptance decisions from the project
  owner.
- **Codex worked in the real repository.** It explored the existing codebase,
  edited React, TypeScript, and Rust files, followed changes across the Tauri
  boundary, and used Git and GitHub to keep the work reviewable.
- **GPT-5.6 powered the reasoning.** The model helped turn product requests into
  implementation plans, trace behavior across multiple files and languages,
  diagnose failures, and propose focused changes.
- **Changes were validated, not simply generated.** Codex ran targeted tests,
  lint and production builds where appropriate, inspected diffs, and iterated on
  issues found during live desktop and browser checks.

Codex and GPT-5.6 were development tools; they are not bundled into the app.
Grimoire currently has no OpenAI API integration, and using it does not require
an OpenAI account or API key.

## Project status

Grimoire is under active development. The browser build is useful for previewing
the interface, but its vault is stored in browser local storage; use the desktop
app when you want Grimoire to work directly with files on disk.
